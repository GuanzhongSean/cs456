# CS456-A2 nEmulator

## Overview

The `Network Emulator` was hosted on `ubuntu2204-014.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca`, the `Sender` was tested on `ubuntu2204-002.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca` and the `Receiver` was tested on `ubuntu2204-004.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca`.

## Usage

### Network Emulator

Parameters:

• `<emulator's receiving UDP port number in the forward (sender) direction>`

• `<receiver's network address>`

• `<receiver's receiving UDP port number>`

• `<emulator's receiving UDP port number in the backward (receiver) direction>`

• `<sender's network address>`

• `<sender's receiving UDP port number>`

• `<maximum delay of the link in units of millisecond>`

• `<packet discard probability>`

• `<verbose-mode>`

Example:

```sh
$ ./nEmulator 50001 ubuntu2204-004.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca 50004 50003 ubuntu2204-002.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca 50002 800 0.2 1
```

### Sender

Parameters:

• `<host address of the network emulator>`

• `<UDP port number used by the emulator to receive data from the sender>`

• `<UDP port number used by the sender to receive ACKs from the emulator>`

• `<timeout interval in units of millisecond>`

• `<N: transmission window size>`

• `<name of the file to be transferred>`

Example:

```sh
$ python sender.py ubuntu2204-014.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca 50001 50002 1000 5 test.txt
```

### Receiver

Parameters:

• `<hostname for the network emulator>`

• `<UDP port number used by the link emulator to receive ACKs from the receiver>`

• `<UDP port number used by the receiver to receive data from the emulator>`

• `<F: buffer size>`

• `<name of the file into which the received data is written>`

Example:

```sh
$ python receiver.py ubuntu2204-014.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca 50003 50004 6 output
```
